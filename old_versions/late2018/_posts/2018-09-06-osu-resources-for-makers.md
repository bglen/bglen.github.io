title: Resources for Makers at Ohio State University
author: Brian Glen

Unfortunately, OSU does not have a university-wide permanet makerspace, such as Think[box] at Case Western Reserve University, or MITERS at MIT. However, with a little bit of fanageling and knowing the right people, you can get access to a whole lot of equipment to make things. Here I have compiled a list of useful resources to an undergrad(in no particular order):

## The Maker Club and MAE Prototying Lab - Bolz 110

## Electronics Club Workshop - Caldwell 234

## Knowlton Laser Cutters - Knowlton Hall 3rd Floor
- 2x Universal Laser Systems 60W VLS6.60 (32 in. x 18 in.)

Hours are posted outside the room. You need to be in the architecture major to access the computers inside the laser cutting lab, however the lab supervisors will log you in if you ask. Architecture students often have end of semester project they need cut, so plan your laser cutting earlier in the semester.

## OSU Tech Hub
- Makerbot Z18 Large Format 3D Printer
	- 11.8 in L x x
