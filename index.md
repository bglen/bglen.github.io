Welcome to my personal website.

This is where I upload projects that people might find interesting. I make all sorts of electronic projects, work on business ideas, modify cars, and never finish things.

Check out my [LinkedIn], [GitHub], and [Devpost] pages. Some projects that I have been working on recently:
