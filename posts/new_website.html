        <p>Finally, a responsive website that doesn't look half bad. It's not hard to make a website, but attempting to make a website that fits in with all of the proffesionally designed sites we see and interact with everyday <b>is</b> hard, especially when you may only see HTML code or inspect a website once every six months or so.</p>
        <p>There is a notion on the internet that building nice, beutiful, responsive sites is much easier now with tools like Bootstrap and jQuery available, and for the most part, that is correct. This website only took a couple of days to throw together, and the return on investment is great for the time I spent. I used the latest version of Bootstrap to build this static site.</p>
        <p>However, like most things, it is not as easy as the internet makes you beleive. There were two versions of this site before adding Bootstrap, so coming in to this I knew HTML5, CSS, and a tiny bit of responsive web design. My site isn't huge or anything, so I figured I could implement bootstrap and have a nice mobile site by the end of the day.</p>
        <p>It was going great until I started implementing solutions like this:</p>
        <code>&lt;div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-center p-3 px-md-4 mb-3 bg-white border-bottom shadow-sm"&gt;</code>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem">That bit of code creates a column to align navigation links to the right of the page, and then stack the links on a mobile device, and adds a tiny bit of styling. As someone that doesn't do this too often, this is a whole lot of bootstrap classes to learn and memorize just to create a nice looking nav bar. It's certainly not impossible, and honestly not that complex either, however I have better things to do with my time.</p>
        <p>Luckily the people at Bootstrap provide examples. This means that I can copy and paste the nice, responsive elements in to my website, and then add in my own styling and content for a pleasant web experience. Not too bad!</p>
